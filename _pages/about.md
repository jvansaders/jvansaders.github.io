I am an assistant astronomer at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. I am most interested in stellar structure and evolution, with an emphasis on rotation, magnetism, asteroseismology, and techniques for inferring stellar ages.


I earned my PhD at The Ohio State University and was a [Carnegie-Princeton Postdoctoral Fellow](http://obs.carnegiescience.edu/fellowships) based at Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, CA. I have been involved in the analysis and theoretical interpretation of stellar time-domain observations from [Kepler/K2](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/) and the ongoing [Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)](https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/). 

Research Interests
===============


Rotational Evolution in Cool Stars
----------------
Stars are born relatively rapidly rotating, and spin down with time due to the interaction of stellar mass loss and magnetic fields. Because this angular momentum loss is significant over the course of a star's life, we can use measurements of rotation periods to infer stellar ages, provided we understand the spin-down behavior. Much of my research focuses on this calibration, and the theoretical underpinnings of period-age relations.
